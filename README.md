## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Improvements

- Decide whether to keep the main project as a monorepo or separate repositories based on a few factors such as Team structure and Resources.
- Continuous Integration depending on services chosen.
- Backend:
  - Use a module per feature approach for better scalability. Each module will have its own controllers, services, etc
  - Use a 3rd party library for Dependency injection such as Inversify.
- Frontend:
  - WIP
